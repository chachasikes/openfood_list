**Knockout** is a JavaScript library that makes it easier to create rich, desktop-like user interfaces with JavaScript and HTML, using *observers* to make your UI automatically stay in sync with an underlying data model. It works particularly well with the [MVVM pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel), offering declarative bindings somewhat like [Silverlight](http://www.silverlight.net/) but without the browser plugin.
