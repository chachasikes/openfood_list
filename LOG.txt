huge updates, put on server w/ mongo, did a lot of interface, sent out to friends for feedback.

next steps
-- seems like sometimes filters lose their change function if scrolling or changing modal or something like that.
-- safari - no message area
-- firefox - slow & no load message  (load message doesn't finish animating)
-- bigger server (500-2gb) -- push current data
-- authentication, maybe have it figured out, but was having memory issues on mongohq. should revisit eventually.
-- backupds mongodump -- do daily, will do googlerefine reconciliations
-- tags - add more
-- suggest new foods that are missing
-- add alternate names
-- store users ip address if logged out
-- foodista attribution
-- image doesn't load except on refresh
-- crons -- category_index.php script
-- limit access to api functions that are administrative
-- open food crosswalk
-- agricultural thesaurus
-- deduplication
-- no nid / flagged / dups / new contributions (reconciliations)

-- showed my friend the interface and she was confused, so i added some labels and some better image attribution
-- worked on adding the entire melon family to see what happens to the interface - cucurbitacae doubles the size of the database, now at 18000+ records.
-- added ability to paste a reference image & credits
-- better color labeling


next steps
-- search autoload is whacked out
-- there is a bug that breaks the modal
