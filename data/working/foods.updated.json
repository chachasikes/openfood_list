It Has An Extremely Strong Odor And Must Be Kept In Airtight Containers. It Becomes More Mild When Cooked However, With A Taste Like Saut&eacute;ed Onion And Garlic. Although Not Native To India, Asafoetida Has For Ages Been An Essential Part Of Indian Cookery And Medicine. It Was Also Believed To Enhance The Musicality Of The Voice. It Is Said That In The Days Of The Mughal Aristocracy The Court Singers Of Agra And Delhi Would Wake Before Dawn Eat A Spoonful Of Asafoetida With Butter And Practice On The Banks Of The River Yamuna. Asafoetida Gets Its Name From The Persian Aza Or Resin And The Latin Foetidus Or Stinking. Due To Its Offensive Smell It Is Also Sometimes Referred To As Devils Dung. How It Grows: Asafoetida Is The Dried Latex From The Rhizomes Of Several Species Of Giant Fennel. It Is Grown Chiefly In Iran And Afghanistan From Where It Is Exported To The Rest Of The World. In India It Is Cultivated In Kashmir. Asafoetida Is The Product Of A Tail Smelly Perennial Herb With Strong Carrot-shaped Roots. The 2-4m Tall Plant Bears Fine Leaves And Yellow Flowers. In March Or April Just Before Flowering The Stalks Are Cut Close To The Root. A Milky Liquid Oozes Out Which Dries To Form Asafoetida. This Is Collected And A Fresh Cut Is Made. This Procedure Lasts For About 3 Months From The First Incision By Which Time The Plant Has Yielded Up To 1kg Of Resin And The Root Has Dried Up. Appearance And Taste: Fresh Asafoetida Is Whitish And Solid And Gradually Turns Pink To Reddish Brown On Exposure To Oxygen. It Is Ochre When Sold Commercially And The Most Widely Used Form Is The Fine Yellow Powder Or Granules. Foetida Has A Pungent Unpleasant Smell Quite Like That Of Pickled Eggs Due To The Presence Of Sulphur Compounds. On Its Own It Tastes Awful But It Is Added To Most Indian Savouries As It Can Complete The Flavour Of A Dish. Buying And Storing: Most Commonly Available Boxed As Powder Or As Granules Asafoetida Is Also Sold As A Hard Lump That Needs To Be Crushed. It Is Best To Buv A Branded Box Of Powder It Is Airtight And Keeps The Sulphurous Odour Of The Spice Locked In. Having A Strong Flavour Asafoetida Keeps Well For Up To A Year. Medicinal And Other Uses: Asafoetida Is Said To Help Flatulence And It Is Also Prescribed For Respiratory Problems Like Whooping Cough And Asthma. Some European Cultures Believe That A Small Piece Of Asafoetida Tied Around A Child's Neck Will Protect It From Disease The Fetid Smell Of The Gum Acting As A Deterrent To Germs. Despite Its Overpowering Smell Asafoetida Is Used In Some Perfumes. Culinary Uses: Its Powerful Aroma Complements Lentils Vegetables And Pickles. Asafoetida Is Used Widely In South India A Surprising Fact Considering That It Does Not Grow There At All. It Is Always Used In Small Quantities A Tiny Pinch Added To Hot Oil Before The Addition Of The Other Ingredients Is Enough To Flavour A Dish For 4.

Take A Visual Inventory Of Your Landscape. Trees Need To Be Fertilized Every Few Years. Shrubs And Other Plants In The Landscape Can Be Fertilized Yearly. A Soil Test Can Determine Existing Nutrient Levels In The Soil. If One Or More Nutrients Is Low, A Specific Instead Of An All-purpose Fertilizer May Be Required. Fertilizers That Are High In N, Nitrogen, Will Promote Green Leafy Growth. Excess Nitrogen In The Soil Can Cause Excessive Vegetative Growth On Plants At The Expense Of Flower Bud Development. It Is Best To Avoid Fertilizing Late In The Growing Season. Applications Made At That Time Can Force Lush, Vegetative Growth That Will Not Have A Chance To Harden Off Before The Onset Of Cold Weather. Light Conditions : Light Conditions Unless A Site Is Completely Exposed, Light Conditions Will Change During The Day And Even During The Year. The Northern And Eastern Sides Of A House Receive The Least Amount Of Light, With The Northern Exsposure Being The Shadiest. The Western And Southern Sides Of A House Receive The Most Light And Are Conidered The Hottest Exposures Due To Intense Afternoon Sun. You Will Notice That Sun And Shade Patterns Change During The Day. The Western Side Of A House May Even Be Shady Due To Shadows Cast By Large Trees Or A Structure From An Adjacent Property. If You Have Just Bought A New Home Or Just Beginning To Garden In Your Older Home, Take Time To Map Sun And Shade Throughout The Day. You Will Get A More Accurate Feel For Your Site's True Light Conditions. Conditions : Types Of Pruning Types Of Pruning Include: Pinching, Thinning, Shearing And Rejuvenating. Pinching Is Removing The Stem Tips Of A Young Plant To Promote Branching. Doing This Avoids The Need For More Severe Pruning Later On. Thinning Involves Removing Whole Branches Back To The Trunk. This May Be Done To Open Up The Interior Of A Plant To Let More Light In And To Increase Air Circulation That Can Cut Down On Plant Disease. The Best Way To Begin Thinning Is To Begin By Removing Dead Or Diseased Wood. Shearing Is Leveling The Surface Of A Shrub Using Hand Or Electric Shears. This Is Done To Maintain The Desired Shape Of A Hedge Or Topiary. Rejuvenating Is Removal Of Old Branches Or The Overall Reduction Of The Size Of A Shrub To Restore Its Original Form And Size. It Is Recommended That You Do Not Remove More Than One Third Of A Plant At A Time. Remember To Remove Branches From The Inside Of The Plant As Well As The Outside. When Rejuvenating Plants With Canes, Such As Nandina, Cut Back Canes At Various Heights So That Plant Will Have A More Natural Look. Conditions : Light And Plant Selection For Best Plant Performance, It Is Desirable To Match The Correct Plant With The Available Light Conditions. Right Plant, Right Place! Plants Which Do Not Receive Sufficient Light May Become Pale In Color, Have Fewer Leaves And A &quot;leggy&quot; Stretched-out Appearance. Also Expect Plants To Grow Slower And Have Fewer Blooms When Light Is Less Than Desirable. It Is Possible To Provide Supplemental Lighting For Indoor Plants With Lamps. Plants Can Also Receive Too Much Light. If A Shade Loving Plant Is Exposed To Direct Sun, It May Wilt And\/or Cause Leaves To Be Sunburned Or Otherwise Damaged. Conditions : Full Sun Full Sun Is Defined As Exposure To More Than 6 Hours Of Continuous, Direct Sun Per Day. Watering Conditions : Regular Moisture For Outdoor Plants Water When Normal Rainfall Does Not Provide The Preferred 1 Inch Of Moisture Most Plants Prefer. Average Water Is Needed During The Growing Season, But Take Care Not To Overwater. The First Two Years After A Plant Is Installed, Regular Watering Is Important. The First Year Is Critical. It Is Better To Water Once A Week And Water Deeply, Than To Water Frequently For A Few Minutes. Conditions : Outdoor Watering Plants Are Almost Completely Made Up Of Water So It Is Important To Supply Them With Adequate Water To Maintain Good Plant Health. Not Enough Water And Roots Will Wither And The Plant Will Wilt And Die. Too Much Water Applied Too Frequently Deprives Roots Of Oxygen Leading To Plant Diseases Such As Root And Stem Rots. The Type Of Plant, Plant Age, Light Level, Soil Type And Container Size All Will Impact When A Plant Needs To Be Watered. Follow These Tips To Ensure Successful Watering: * The Key To Watering Is Water Deeply And Less Frequently. When Watering, Water Well, I.e. Provide Enough Water To Thoroughly Saturate The Root Ball. With In-ground Plants, This Means Thoroughly Soaking The Soil Until Water Has Penetrated To A Depth Of 6 To 7 Inches (1' Being Better). With Container Grown Plants, Apply Enough Water To Allow Water To Flow Through The Drainage Holes. * Try To Water Plants Early In The Day Or Later In The Afternoon To Conserve Water And Cut Down On Plant Stress. Do Water Early Enough So That Water Has Had A Chance To Dry From Plant Leaves Prior To Night Fall. This Is Paramount If You Have Had Fungus Problems. * Don't Wait To Water Until Plants Wilt. Although Some Plants Will Recover From This, All Plants Will Die If They Wilt Too Much (when They Reach The Permanent Wilting Point). * Consider Water Conservation Methods Such As Drip Irrigation, Mulching, And Xeriscaping. Drip Systems Which Slowly Drip Moisture Directly On The Root System Can Be Purchased At Your Local Home And Garden Center. Mulches Can Significantly Cool The Root Zone And Conserve Moisture. * Consider Adding Water-saving Gels To The Root Zone Which Will Hold A Reserve Of Water For The Plant. These Can Make A World Of Difference Especially Under Stressful Conditions. Be Certain To Follow Label Directions For Their Use. Planting How-tos : Pruning Trees After Planting It Is Critical To Prune Trees Correctly From The Beginning To Assure Proper Growth And Development. Young Trees Can Be Transplanted In A Number Of Forms: Bare Root, Balled &amp; Burlap And In Containers. The More Stress The Plant Undergoes In The Transplant Process, The More Pruning That Is Required To Compensate. Deciduous Trees Like Maples (those That Loose Their Leaves In The Fall) Can Be Dug Up And Sold With Their Bare Roots Exposed. Because Most Of The Root System Is Lost In Digging, Sufficient Top Growth Should Be Removed To Compensate For This Loss. This May Be Done At The Nursery Before You Buy The Plant Or You May Have To Prune At The Time Of Planting. Select And Head Back The Best Scaffold Branches, I.e. Those Branches Which Will Form The Main Lateral Structure Of The Future Mature Tree. Remove All Other Extraneous Side Branches. If The Tree Seedling Does Not Have Branches, Allow It To Grow To The Desired Height Of Branching Then Pinch It Back To Stimulate The Lower Buds To Form Branches. Ball And Burlap Trees Are Dug Up With Their Root Systems Somewhat Intact. This Was Mostly Done For Conifers And Broadleaf Evergreens, But Has Become Common For Deciduous Trees As Well. Since Some Root Mass Is Lost In The Digging Stage, A Light Pruning Is Generally Called For. Head Back The Plant To Compensate For This Loss And To Promote Branching. Trees That Are Grown In Containers Generally Do Not Loose Roots In The Transplanting Phase. Therefore You Do Not Generally Have To Prune Them Unless There Is Some Root Injury Or Limb Damage In The Planting Process. Once You Have Your Trees Planted, Be Patient. Do Not Remove Shoots From The Trunk Early On As These Allow The Tree To Grow More Rapidly And Also Shade The Tender Young Trunk From Sun-scald. Wait A Few Years To Begin Training The Tree To Its Ultimate Form. How-tos : Staking Trees Staking Is Done Differently Depending On The Size And Flexibility Of The Tree, And The Windiness Of The Planting Site. Generally Only Trees That Are Planted In Windy, Exposed Locations Need To Be Staked. For Most Trees, A Low Stake Is Preferred, To Let The Tree Move Naturally. For Windy Areas Or Flexible Trees, Use A High Stake. For Trees More Than 12 Feet Tall, Use Two Low Stakes On Opposite Sides Of The Tree Or Several Guy Ropes. The Ties Used Need To Accommodate Growth And Not Cause Bark Damage With Friction. Buckle-and-spacer Ties Can Be Found At Garden Centers, They Are Expandable And Have A Protective Spacer. Ties Without Spacers Should Be Formed Into A Figure Eight To Create Padding. Latest Studies Have Shown That When Staking A Tree, Provide Enough Leeway So That The Tree Can Move Back And Forth In The Wind. Stronger Roots Will Develop This Way. If The Tree Can Not Move Back And Forth, These Important Roots Will Not Develop And The Tree Might Fall Over During A Storm, Once Stakes Are Removed. When Planting A Tree, Stake At The Time Of Planting If Staking Is A Necessity. How-tos : Planting A Tree Dig Out An Area For The Tree That Is About 3 Or 4 Times The Diameter Of The Container Or Rootball And The Same Depth As The Container Or Rootball. Use A Pitchfork Or Shovel To Scarify The Sides Of The Hole. If Container-grown, Lay The Tree On Its Side And Remove The Container. Loosen The Roots Around The Edges Without Breaking Up The Root Ball Too Much. Position Tree In Center Of Hole So That The Best Side Faces Forward. You Are Ready To Begin Filling In With Soil. If Planting A Balled And Burlaped Tree, Position It In Hole So That The Best Side Faces Forward. Untie Or Remove Nails From Burlap At Top Of Ball And Pull Burlap Back, So It Does Not Stick Out Of Hole When Soil Is Replaced. Synthetic Burlap Should Be Removed As It Will Not Decompose Like Natural Burlap. Larger Trees Often Come In Wire Baskets. Plant As You Would A B&amp;b Plant, But Cut As Much Of The Wire Away As Possible Without Actually Removing The Basket. Chances Are, You Would Do More Damage To The Rootball By Removing The Basket. Simply Cut Away Wires To Leave Several Large Openings For Roots. Fill Both Holes With Soil The Same Way. Never Amend With Less Than Half Original Soil. Recent Studies Show That If Your Soil Is Loose Enough, You Are Better Off Adding Little Or No Soil Amendments. Create A Water Ring Around The Outer Edge Of The Hole. Not Only Will This Conseve Water, But Will Direct Moisture To Perimeter Roots, Encouraging Outer Growth. Once Tree Is Established, Water Ring May Be Leveled. Studies Show That Mulched Trees Grow Faster Than Those Unmulched, So Add A 3&quot;&quot; Layer Of Pinestraw, Compost, Or Pulverized Bark Over Backfilled Area. Remove Any Damaged Limbs. Problems Pest : Maggots Maggots Live In The Soil, Chew The Root Hairs Off Of Plants And Love To Tunnel Through Root Crops Such As Onions, Garlic And Leeks. They Are About 1\/3 Of An Inch Long, Glossy White And Blunt-headed. Adults Are Dark Grey Flies That Resemble The Common Housefly. Prevenion And Control: Floating Row Covers Or Cheesecloth Set Over Seedbeds In Early Spring May Deter Egg Laying On Young Plants. Crop Rotation Is A Must. Always Remove And Destroy Infected Plants. Beneficial Nemtodes Will Prey On Maggots As Well. Till Soil Well In The Fall To Expose And Destroy Pupae. Pest : Aphids Aphids Are Small, Soft-bodied, Slow-moving Insects That Suck Fluids From Plants. Aphids Come In Many Colors, Ranging From Green To Brown To Black, And They May Have Wings. They Attack A Wide Range Of Plant Species Causing Stunting, Deformed Leaves And Buds. They Can Transmit Harmful Plant Viruses With Their Piercing\/sucking Mouthparts. Aphids, Generally, Are Merely A Nuisance, Since It Takes Many Of Them To Cause Serious Plant Damage. However Aphids Do Produce A Sweet Substance Called Honeydew (coveted By Ants) Which Can Lead To An Unattractive Black Surface Growth Called Sooty Mold. Aphids Can Increase Quickly In Numbers And Each Female Can Produce Up To 250 Live Nymphs In The Course Of A Month Without Mating. Aphids Often Appear When The Environment Changes - Spring &amp; Fall. They're Often Massed At The Tips Of Branches Feeding On Succulent Tissue. Aphids Are Attracted To The Color Yellow And Will Often Hitchhike On Yellow Clothing. Prevention And Control: Keep Weeds To An Absolute Minimum, Especially Around Desirable Plants. On Edibles, Wash Off Infected Area Of Plant. Lady Bugs And Lacewings Will Feed On Aphids In The Garden. There Are Various Products - Organic And Inorganic - That Can Be Used To Control Aphids. Seek The Recommendation Of A Professional And Follow All Label Procedures To A Tee. Fungi : Rusts Most Rusts Are Host Specific And Overwinter On Leaves, Stems And Spent Flower Debris. Rust Often Appears As Small, Bright Orange, Yellow, Or Brown Pustules On The Underside Of Leaves. If Touched, It Will Leave A Colored Spot Of Spores On The Finger. Caused By Fungi And Spread By Splashing Water Or Rain, Rust Is Worse When Weather Is Moist. Prevention And Control: Plant Resistant Varieties And Provide Maximum Air Circulation. Clean Up All Debris, Especially Around Plants That Have Had A Problem. Do Not Water From Overhead And Water Only During The Day So That Plants Will Have Enough Time To Dry Before Night. Apply A Fungicide Labeled For Rust On Your Plant. Pest : Caterpillars Caterpillars Are The Immature Form Of Moths And Butterflies. They Are Voracious Feeders Attacking A Wide Variety Of Plants. They Can Be Highly Destructive And Are Characterized As Leaf Feeders, Stem Borers, Leaf Rollers, Cutworms And Tent-formers. Prevention And Control: Keep Weeds Down, Scout Individual Plants And Remove Caterpillars, Apply Labeled Insecticides Such As Soaps And Oils, Take Advantage Of Natural Enemies Such As Parasitic Wasps In The Garden And Use Bacillus Thuringiensis (biological Warfare) For Some Caterpillar Species. Diseases : Blight Blights Are Cause By Fungi Or Bacteria That Kill Plant Tissue. Symptoms Often Show Up As The Rapid Spotting Or Wilting Of Foliage. There Are Many Different Blights, Specific To Various Plants, Each Requiring A Varied Method Of Control. Diseases : Apple Scab Apple Scab Fungus Thrives In Cool, Moist Areas And Overwinters In Infected Leaves That Have Fallen To The Ground. In Spring, Spores Infect New Leaves, Stems, Flowers And Fruit. If Conditions Are Right (wet And 70 Degrees), The Fungus Can Infect The Fruit Around The Bloom In Just 6 Hours, Though Visible Signs May Not Be Noticed For A Couple Of Weeks. Infection First Appears As A Dark Green Or Black Irregular Patch On Leaf Surfaces. It Is Not Uncommon For Leaves To Pucker And Become Discolored And Eventually Fall Of The Tree. Scab On Fruit Shows Up As A Brownish Patch With A White Halo. Older Lesions Will Not Have The Halo. Prevention And Control: Plant Resistant Varieties Whenever Possible. Remember, Resistant Does Not Mean Immune. Keep Trees Properly Pruned To Promote Good Air Circulation And Always Rake Up And Destroy Fallen Leaves. If You Have A Known Problem From Previous Years, Treat With An Appropriate Fungicide Early On. Follow All Directions On The Label - Make Sure The Fungicide You Select Is Labelled For Use On That Plant To Control Apple Scab It Is Too Late To Treat If You See Scab On Fruit And Trees. Fungi : Cedar Apple Rust Cedar Apple Rust Requires Two Alternate Hosts Each Year: Cedar Or Juniper Type Plants And Apples, Crabapples Or Hawthorn. Between Spring And Early Summer, Infected Juniper Or Cedar Leaves And Stems May Swell With Greenish-brown Galls. By Fall, The Galls Have Developed Dimples. Though These Do No Immediate Harm To The Plant, By The Following Spring, When Weather Is Wet And Warm, The Galls Swell And Develop Jelly-like Horn Protrusions. Spores Produced By These Horns Then Infect Apple Trees. Wind Carried Spores Are Capable Of Infecting Trees Up To 4 Miles Away. On Apples, Cedar Apple Rust Appears As Rusty Orange Spots, Having A Ring-like Appearance. Fruit Drop Is Also Common. Prevention And Control Plant Resistant Varieties And Eliminate Hosts From The Area. Chinese And Savin Junipers Seem To Be Resistant As Are Apple Varieties Freedom, Liberty, And Priscilla. Always Rake-up And Destroy Diseased Or Damaged Fruit And Leaves. There Are No Chemicals Available Labeled For Home Gardener Use. Miscellaneous Glossary : Naturalizing Naturalizing Refers To Planting In A Random Pattern, Much As Itwould Occur In Nature. If You Spend Any Time In The Woods, You've Probably Noticed That Plants Often Grow In Groups. The Center Of The Group Is Dense And Towards The Edges, Plants Are Located Farther Apart. Narcissus Bulbs Are Easy To Naturalize If You Use This Method: Fill A Bucket With Bulbs And Toss Them Out. Plant Them Where They Fall. You Will Notice A Portion Of The Bulbs Are Close Together While The Others Have Scattered Farther Away.

Production Is About 12.5 Tons Of Marketable Roots Per Acre And They Sell For $460.00 Per Ton, Giving The Crop A Value Of $45,500,000 Per Year. The Sweetpotato Crop Is Started As &ldquo;slips&rdquo; In The Spring In Hot Beds From Roots That Are Stored Over Winter. The Hot Bed Slips Are Harvested In May And June And Transplanted Into Fields Around The Livingston And Atwater Areas. These Sandy Soils Are Preferred For Sweetpotato Production Because They Produce The Bestshaped Roots. The Crop Is Harvested July Through October. The Roots Are Then Stored At 55&deg; F Until They Are Brought To The Packing Line, Sorted And Packed Into 40 Pound Boxes For Shipping. Most Of The Sweetpotatoes Grown In Merced County Are Shipped To Other Parts Of The United States And To Canada. Approximately 22 Packing Facilities Operate Year-round To Fill Orders From Clients On An &ldquo;as Needed&rdquo; Basis. Few Sweetpotatoes Are Used Locally As There Are No Canning, Freezing Or Other Packing Facilities. The Nutritive Value Of Sweetpotatoes Is Very High. They Are A Good Source Of Complex Carbohydrates; Of Calcium, Iron, And Other Minerals; And Of Vitamins &ndash; Especially Vitamin A And Beta-carotene. One Source Refers To The Sweetpotatoes As The Most Nutritious Food.

It Is A Very Old Tree, And Could Be Victoria's Oldest Apple Tree. It Is Assocaited With John Batman The So Called Founder Of The City Of Melbourne Thanks To Local Historian Bruce Draper For Permission To Include His Article On Wikinorthia. Our Neighbouring Area Of Templestowe In The City Of Manningham Has A Heritage Of Apple Growing. Petty's Orchard Now Operated By Parks Victoria Is A Great Place To Visit. On The Eastern Bank Of The Plenty River At Greensborough Stands A Solitary Apple Tree, Referred To As The Batman Apple Tree. The Story Behind It Is Both Fascinating And Of Historical Interest. The Tree, Once Part Of An Orchard Planted By Frederick Flintoff, Is On A Small River Flat, Adjacent To The Maroondah Aqueduct Pipe Crossing. Nearby Is A Plaque Marking The Site Of A Private Cemetery For The Pioneer Whatmough And Partington Families. The 1841 Census Reported The Presence Of Frederick Nevin Flintoff On The Plenty At Greensborough. An Unfinished And Uninhabited Wood House Stood On His Property, Which Was Given The Name Brancepeth. In 1890, Brancepeth Farm Comprised 200 Acres Owned By Mr. F. Flintoff Jnr., With &lsquo;the Garden In The Valley And The Farm On Top Of The Hill&rsquo;. The Orchard Of &lsquo;some Seven Acres&rsquo; Planted Along The River Banks Was For Many Years&rsquo; Leased By Mr. Whatmough. Considered One Of The Oldest In The District, The Orchard At This Time Had &lsquo;the Appearance Of Being Worn Out&rsquo;. The Following Account Of A Conversation Between The Writer And Mr. T. Flintoff, Comes From The Evelyn Observer Of February 1890. &lsquo;it Appears The Majority Of Trees In The Garden Were, In The First Place, Brought Over From Van Diemen&rsquo;s Land By Mr. John Batman And Planted In His Garden At The Survey Camp, &hellip; After Batman&rsquo;s Death, The Trees Were Sold, And In September 1841 Mr. Flintoff Bought A Number At One Pound A Piece And Brought Them To And Planted Them In The Greensborough District; A Few Years After They Were Transplanted To The Garden In Question And Have Remained There Ever Since.&rsquo; Mr. Carr Who &lsquo;had Leased The Orchard' For The Last 10 Or 11 Years Showed The Writer &lsquo;an Underground Cellar (a Drive In The Side Of The Hill) For Storing Fruit. An Account Of The Origin Of The Tree, Recorded By Edward E. Pescott In The Victorian Naturalist Of June 1942, Is Based On His 1933 Conversation With Flintoff&rsquo;s Daughter. Her Story &lsquo;was That Flintoff Ordered His Bailiff, Batey, To Plant The Tree As A Memorial To His Friend Batman.&rsquo; [edit] Grafting In 1910, E.e. Pescott, Then Principal Of Burnley Horticultural College, Recommended To The Then Owner Of The Orchard Mr. J.a. Bosch, That The Tree Be Grafted Over &lsquo;with Strong Growing Varieties, And Also That Crevices In The Trunk Be Filled With Cement. This He Did. The Tree Was Grafted Over With The Rome Beauty And Rymer Varieties. An Article In The Leader Of November 22, 1913, Under The Heading &lsquo;making Good On A Small Acreage&rsquo; Describes A Visit To The Six-acre Garden Of Mr. J.a. Bosch Of Greensborough. &lsquo;when Mr. Bosch Came Into Possession, Some Fifteen Years Ago, There Was An Old Orchard On The Place Which Had Never Done Any Good, And He Was Advised Not To Attempt Fruit Growing, But Out Came A Lot Of The Old Trees And In Went A Much Larger Acreage Of New Ones, Principally Apples And Peaches.&rsquo; The Apple Varieties Were Mainly Rome Beauty, Rymer And Jonathan. &hellip; &lsquo;among The Younger Trees Is An Old Veteran, Sole Survivor Of The Original Orchard. It Was A Rymer Apple, But Has Recently Been Cut Back And Grafted To Rome Beauty.&rsquo; W.a. (bill) Rolfe, Senior Horticultural Adviser With The Department Of Agriculture, Wrote In The Victorian Horticulture Digest In 1966: &lsquo;an Examination Of The Wood Suggests That Part Of The Tree Is Rymer And Another Part Which Appears To Come From A Growth Below The Original Graft Possibly Winter Majetin.&rsquo; The Winter Majetin Variety Is A Norfolk Apple Dating Back To 1820. Today A Block Of Cement Inscribed With The Date 1841 Stands Alongside The Trunk. A Number Of Legends Have Grown Up About The Tree&rsquo;s Origin. The Account Given By T. Flintoff To The Writer Of Sketches &lsquo;in And Around The Valley Of The Diamond Creek&rsquo;, Published In The Evelyn Observer, In 1890 Is Probably The Most Reliable. John Batman Died On 6 May 1839. A Fruit Tree Nursery Or Small Fruit Garden Was Often Established While Orchard Land Was Being Cleared And Prepared For Cultivation. Successive Plantings Would Then Take Place To Establish A New Orchard. The Flintoff Orchard Likely Started In 1841 With The Planting Of Trees, Once A Part Of John Batman&rsquo;s Fruit Garden. The Sole Survivor Of That Orchard Is Said To Be One Of The Original Batman Apple Trees, Which Would Likely Make It The Oldest Living Apple Tree In Victoria\n","flagged":null,"food_color_background":null,"food_color_text":null,"foodcards_categories":null,"freebase_id":null,"in_foodgenome":null,"in_foodista":null,"is_duplicate":null,"link_svg":null,"name":"Batmans Tree Apple","nid":6446,"node_uuid":null,"notes":null,"path":"http:\/\/openfood.local\/node\/6446","processing":null,"scientific_name":null,"simple_name":null,"updated":null,"updated_date":"Tuesday, February 21, 2012 - 16:01","variety":null},{"_id":{"$id":"4f7fb196d2ec3929ef3610ca"},"alternate_names":null,"background_color_hsv_h":0,"background_color_hsv_s":null,"background_color_hsv_v":null,"background_color_rgb_b":null,"background_color_rgb_g":null,"background_color_rgb_r":null,"category":null,"category_array":[""],"classification_family":null,"classification_order":null,"datasource":"mixed","depiction":"http:\/\/cloud.foodista.com\/content\/misc\/placeholders\/food_big","description":"Battleford Apple Features Showy Clusters Of Lightly-scented White Flowers With Shell Pink Overtones Along The Branches In Mid Spring, Which Emerge From Distinctive Pink Flower Buds Having Forest Green Foliage Throughout The Season\n","flagged":null,"food_color_background":null,"food_color_text":null,"foodcards_categories":null,"freebase_id":null,"in_foodgenome":null,"in_foodista":null,"is_duplicate":null,"link_svg":null,"name":"Battleford Apple","nid":6447,"node_uuid":null,"notes":null,"path":"http:\/\/openfood.local\/node\/6447","processing":null,"scientific_name":null,"simple_name":null,"updated":null,"updated_date":"Tuesday, February 21, 2012 - 16:01","variety":null},{"_id":{"$id":"4f7fb196d2ec3929ef3610cb"},"alternate_names":null,"background_color_hsv_h":0,"background_color_hsv_s":null,"background_color_hsv_v":null,"background_color_rgb_b":null,"background_color_rgb_g":null,"background_color_rgb_r":null,"category":null,"category_array":[""],"classification_family":null,"classification_order":null,"datasource":"mixed","depiction":"http:\/\/cloud.foodista.com\/content\/images\/3b5d8737e3db96bfd93d89c8a9ad422d025d824c_607x400.jpg","description":"A Small, Green Fruit Used As A Souring Agent In Negros Or Iloilo.

And Is A Great Affordable Choice To Serve To Your Family And Guests. The Beef Bottom Round Roast Is Less Tender Than The Top Round Roast Due To Its Muscle Construction, Hence Its Fibrous Structure That With Slow Cooking Braised In Liquid Helps Break Down The Fibrous Meat Into A Wonderfully Tender Treat . The Two Muscles Of This Roast Are The Eye Of The Round On The Left And The Bottom Round On The Right Of A Cow. Note The Heavy Band Of Connective Tissue Separating The Muscles Should You Be Looking At A 'map' Of A Cow.

After Pruning, The Patch Of Soil Beneath The Trees Is Kept Weed-free, And The Grass Rows Between The Trees In The Orchard Are Mowed. The Orchard Is Given A Fertilizer Dressing And Watered. In The Summer The Apples Are Thinned Out, This Means That A Number Of Fruits Are Removed From Each Tree To Achieve Optimum Fruit Growth And Enhance Tree Vigour. The Peak Of The Apple Season Falls Between The End Of August And Early October. Apples Are Ripe In These Months, Certain Varieties Earlier Than Others. Apples Are Picked By Hand; The Stem Is Gently Bent Before The Apple Is Carefully Removed From The Branch. The Stem Must Be Left On The Apple. An Apple Without A Stem Is 'wounded' And The Fruit Is Likely To Rot At This Point. Young Apple Trees Will Give Around Six Kilos Of Fruit, While Mature Trees Produce Up To Twenty Kilos. In Autumn Older Apple Trees Are Cut Down. Fruit Growers Then Plant New Trees From Mid November Until May To Replace The Old Ones. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Apples Can Be Kept For About 2 Weeks After Purchase. The Best Place To Store Apples Is The Vegetable Compartment In The Fridge. Apples Emit Ethylene That Accelerates The Ripening Process So Do Not Store Them Near Other Produce Such As Cucumbers And Tomatoes. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Apples Can Be Eaten Raw. They Can Also Be Cooked, Baked In Pies Or Preserved. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Nutritional Value Per 100 G Energy: 207 Kj, 49 Kcal Protein: 0.4 G Iron: 0.2 Mg Carbohydrates: 11.8 G Sodium: 2 Mg Calcium: 4 Mg Fat: 0.0 G Fibre: 2.3 G Vitamin C: 8 Mg -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- - Dessert And Eating Apples Just Need Rinsing And Drying. - Peel Cooking Apples Just Before Use.
